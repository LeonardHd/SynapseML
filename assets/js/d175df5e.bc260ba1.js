The varied computational footprints of modern ML algorithms and the myriad of database technologies, each with their own restrictive syntax, make such tasks more than a little complex. We introduce an Apache Spark-based micro-service orchestration \x3c!--truncate--\x3e framework that extends database operations to include web service primitives. Our system can orchestrate web services across hundreds of machines and takes full advantage of cluster, thread, and asynchronous parallelism. Using this framework, we provide large scale clients for intelligent services such as speech, vision, search, anomaly detection, and text analysis. These clients allow users to integrate ready-to-use intelligence into any datastore with an Apache Spark connector. To eliminate much of the overhead from network communication, we also introduce a low-latency containerized version of our architecture. We demonstrate that the services we investigate are competitive on several important benchmarks. Finally, we present two applications of this framework to create intelligent search engines and real-time auto race analytics systems.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/large-scale-services/)"},{"id":"/2019/10/02/MMLSpark empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","metadata":{"permalink":"/SynapseML/blog/2019/10/02/MMLSpark empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","source":"@site/blog/2019-10-02-MMLSpark empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton.md","title":"MMLSpark: empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","description":"MMLSpark: empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","date":"2019-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 2, 2019","tags":[],"readingTime":0.85,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"MMLSpark: empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","description":"MMLSpark: empowering AI for Good with Mark Hamilton","keywords":["AI for good","Microsoft Research","Podcast"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Publication - Large-Scale Intelligent Microservices","permalink":"/SynapseML/blog/2020/12/01/Large-Scale Intelligent Microservices"},"nextItem":{"title":"Dear Spark developers: Welcome to Azure Cognitive Services","permalink":"/SynapseML/blog/2019/08/24/Welcome to Azure Cognitive Services"}},"content":"<img src=\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/09/Mark-Hamilton_Podcast_Site_09_2019_1400x788.png\\" />\\n\\n<h4>Episode 92, October 2, 2019</h4>\\n\\nIf someone asked you what snow leopards and Vincent Van Gogh have in common, you might think it was the beginning of a joke. \x3c!--truncate--\x3e It\u2019s not. but if it was, Mark Hamilton, budding PhD student, member of Microsoft\u2019s Cognitive Services group and frequent Microsoft Research collaborator, would tell you the punch line is machine learning.
